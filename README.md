## What is spaMM ?

__spaMM__ is an R package originally designed for fitting __spa__ tial generalized linear __M__ ixed __M__ odels, particularly the so-called geostatistical model allowing prediction in continuous space. But it is now a more general-purpose package for fitting mixed models, spatial or not, and with efficient methods for both geostatistical and autoregressive models. Its latest major addition is the ability to fit multivariate-response models. 

## What to look for (or not) here ?
There is not much to look here yet. The current public repository is here: [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.mbb.univ-montp2.fr/francois/spamm-ref).
